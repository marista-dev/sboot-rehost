"""derived_facts.py - measure what the analyst actually added, instead of asking it.

The loop needs to know whether a re-derivation produced anything new. Asking the
analyst ("how many new facts did you find?") makes the stop condition depend on a
self-reported number that nothing can contradict, so the same address gets
"newly derived" every round and the loop never ends.

The analyst appends its findings to one record per firmware - the `## 도출된 정지점`
table in STATIC.md / KERNEL_STATIC.md. This script parses that table, remembers
every signature it has already seen in derived_facts.jsonl, and reports how many
are new. Re-deriving the same stop point adds no row, so `new` is 0 and the
exhaustion condition becomes a fact rather than a claim.

Usage:
  derived_facts.py <workdir> [--peek]

  --peek   report without recording, so a caller can look without consuming

Output: JSON on stdout
